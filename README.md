# bffs - The Game

A co-op 2D arcade puzzle game I made over the winter holidays for the GMD competition hosted by the UofT GDDC. 

## Installation

Download everything in ` Release/release_v1_windows ` and make sure the ` .dll  ` files and the ` assets ` folder are in the same level.

Then run the executable file. You can delete the maps in ` assets/maps/ ` and the game will generate new ones upon rerun.

## Built With

* [SDL 2](https://www.libsdl.org/) - low level media library

## Acknowledgments

* A decent amount of the wrappers were first based off [Lazy Foo's Productions](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php) tutorials from which I learned a large amount of game development with SDL.
* The music has a Kanye sample.
